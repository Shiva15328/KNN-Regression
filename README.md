KNN-Regression algorithm used to build the model.
The data set containing Height(Inches), Weight(Pounds) was taken from kaggle.com.
Height(Inches) is given to x, Weight(pounds) is given to y.
Found exact value of K= 10 having least RMSE value by running K values in range (1,25) in loop. Therefore n_neighbors=10.
Used euclidean distance and manhattan distance to good fit.
Tested algorithm by giving input values.
